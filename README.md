# Medical_MemNet
This is a repository for developing a memory network-based system for medical records (aka DARE-KVMemNN).

Roadmap for the Memory Network Model(Feb. 2018)

A. Testing a key-value MemNN implemented with PyTorch on Comet with Singularity

   (see  https://github.com/berlino/MemNN )
   
B. Developing a prototype single model key-value MemNN with PyTorch

C. Developing a distributed meta-learning version (DARE-KVMemNN) and benchmarking with Comet and Bridges


BioNLP for PubMed

A. LSU DigitalScholoarship

B. 60 hours of student worker support

C. python scripts for biomedical text mining and Ke-Value data processing
