DASK scheduler set up on HPC

dask-scheduler --scheduler-file /path/to/scheduler.json  # writes address to file

dask-worker --scheduler-file /path/to/scheduler.json  # reads file for address
dask-worker --scheduler-file /path/to/scheduler.json  # reads file for address
>>> client = Client(scheduler_file='/path/to/scheduler.json')

This can be particularly useful when deploying dask-scheduler and dask-worker processes using a job scheduler like SGE/SLURM/Torque/etc. Here is an example using SGEâ€™s qsub command:

# Start a dask-scheduler somewhere and write the connection information to a file
qsub -b y /path/to/dask-scheduler --scheduler-file /home/$USER/scheduler.json

# Start 100 dask-worker processes in an array job pointing to the same file
qsub -b y -t 1-100 /path/to/dask-worker --scheduler-file /home/$USER/scheduler.json
